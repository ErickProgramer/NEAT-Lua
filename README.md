# NEAT-Lua
## What is?
[NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies) (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an evolutionary algorithm that tries to find the best Network to solve a give problem. NEAT-Lua implements this algorithm in a clean and fast way, and of course, easy to use. If you've never heard of NEAT before, go read the [Stanley's Paper](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf)

## Why?
Because I like Lua and [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) (Machine Learning) in general, and I didn't find any library for this stuff.

## Starting
### Installation
To install, just type this command in the root of your directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ErickProgramer/NEAT-Lua NEAT
```
And now you can use this:
```lua
local Genome = require "NEAT.Genome"
local Population = require "NEAT.Population"
```

### Documentation
The documentation is available [here](https://erickprogramer.github.io/NEAT-Lua)
